## Development Notes

- Use `npm run lint` to check code style.
- Fonts and assets are linked in `react-native.config.js`.
- Avoid mutation — use immutable updates and functional patterns.
- Screens are built with educational layout components: `Section`, `Note`, `CodeBlock`, and `List`.
- `ScreenLayout` wraps all screens in a consistent styled container.
